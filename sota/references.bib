@article{kang2017prediction,
abstract = {In recent years, various studies have been conducted on the prediction of crime occurrences. This predictive capability is intended to assist in crime prevention by facilitating effective implementation of police patrols. Previous studies have used data from multiple domains such as demographics, economics, and education. Their prediction models treat data from different domains equally. These methods have problems in crime occurrence prediction, such as difficulty in discovering highly nonlinear relationships, redundancies, and dependencies between multiple datasets. In order to enhance crime prediction models, we consider environmental context information, such as broken windows theory and crime prevention through environmental design. In this paper, we propose a feature-level data fusion method with environmental context based on a deep neural network (DNN). Our dataset consists of data collected from various online databases of crime statistics, demographic and meteorological data, and images in Chicago, Illinois. Prior to generating training data, we select crime-related data by conducting statistical analyses. Finally, we train our DNN, which consists of the following four kinds of layers: spatial, temporal, environmental context, and joint feature representation layers. Coupled with crucial data extracted from various domains, our fusion DNN is a product of an efficient decision-making process that statistically analyzes data redundancy. Experimental performance results show that our DNN model is more accurate in predicting crime occurrence than other prediction models.},

abstract = {Owing to improvements in image recognition via deep learning, machine-learning algorithms could eventually be applied to automated medical diagnoses that can guide clinical decision-making. However, these algorithms remain a ‘black box' in terms of how they generate the predictions from the input data. Also, high-performance deep learning requires large, high-quality training datasets. Here, we report the development of an understandable deep-learning system that detects acute intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) and classifies five ICH subtypes from unenhanced head computed-tomography scans. By using a dataset of only 904 cases for algorithm training, the system achieved a performance similar to that of expert radiologists in two independent test datasets containing 200 cases (sensitivity of 98{\%} and specificity of 95{\%}) and 196 cases (sensitivity of 92{\%} and specificity of 95{\%}). The system includes an attention map and a prediction basis retrieved from training data to enhance explainability, and an iterative process that mimics the workflow of radiologists. Our approach to algorithm development can facilitate the development of deep-learning systems for a variety of clinical applications and accelerate their adoption into clinical practice.},

abstract = {The aim of this contribution is to analyse the real borderlines of the 'right to explanation' in the GDPR and to discretely distinguish between dif ferent levels of information and of consumers' awareness in the 'black box society. In order to combine transparency and comprehensibility we propose the new concept of algorithm 'legibility'. We argue that a systemic interpretation is needed in this field, since it can be beneficial not only for individuals but also for businesses. This may be an opportunity for auditing algorithms and correcting unknown machine biases, thus similarly enhancing the quality of decision-making outputs. Accordingly, we show how a systemic interpretation of Articles 13-15 and 22 GDPR is necessary, considering in particular that: The threshold of minimum human intervention required so that the decision-making is 'solely' automated (Article 22(1)) can also include nominal human intervention; the envisaged 'significant effects' on individuals (Article 22(1)) can encompass as well marketing manipulation, price discrimination, etc; 'meaningful information' that should be pro-vided to data subjects about the logic, signifi-cance and consequences of decision-making (Article 15(1 )(h){\textgreater} should be read as 'legibility' of 'architecture' and 'implementation' of algorith-mic processing; trade secret protection might limit the right of access of data subjects, but there is a general legal favour for data protection rights that should reduce the impact of trade secrets protection. In addition, we recommend a 'legibility test' that data controllers should perform in order to com-ply with the duty to provide meaningful information about the logic involved in an automated decision-making.},

However, the black-box nature of deep neural networks challenges its use in mission critical applications, raising ethical and judicial concerns inducing lack of trust. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that promotes a set of tools, techniques, and algorithms that can generate high-quality interpretable, intuitive, human-understandable explanations of AI decisions. In addition to providing a holistic view of the current XAI landscape in deep learning, this paper provides mathematical summaries of seminal work. We start by proposing a taxonomy and categorizing the XAI techniques based on their scope of explanations, methodology behind the algorithms, and explanation level or usage which helps build trustworthy, interpretable, and self-explanatory deep learning models. We then describe the main principles used in XAI research and present the historical timeline for landmark studies in XAI from 2007 to 2020. After explaining each category of algorithms and approaches in detail, we then evaluate the explanation maps generated by eight XAI algorithms on image data, discuss the limitations of this approach, and provide potential future directions to improve XAI evaluation.},

In this paper we introduce a taxonomy and a set of descriptors that can be used to characterise and systematically assess explainable systems along five key dimensions: functional, operational, usability, safety and validation. In order to design a comprehensive and representative taxonomy and associated descriptors we surveyed the eXplainable Artificial Intelligence literature, extracting the criteria and desiderata that other authors have proposed or implicitly used in their research. The survey includes papers introducing new explainability algorithms to see what criteria are used to guide their development and how these algorithms are evaluated, as well as papers proposing such criteria from both computer science and social science perspectives. This novel framework allows to systematically compare and contrast explainability approaches, not just to better understand their capabilities but also to identify discrepancies between their theoretical qualities and properties of their implementations. We developed an operationalisation of the framework in the form of Explainability Fact Sheets, which enable researchers and practitioners alike to quickly grasp capabilities and limitations of a particular explainable method. When used as a Work Sheet, our taxonomy can guide the development of new explainability approaches by aiding in their critical evaluation along the five proposed dimensions.},

abstract = {Deep learning models contributed to reaching unprecedented results in prediction and classification tasks of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. However, alongside this notable progress, they do not provide human-understandable insights on how a specific result was achieved. In contexts where the impact of AI on human life is relevant (e.g., recruitment tools, medical diagnoses, etc.), explainability is not only a desirable property, but it is-or, in some cases, it will be soon-a legal requirement. Most of the available approaches to implement eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) focus on technical solutions usable only by experts able to manipulate the recursive mathematical functions in deep learning algorithms. A complementary approach is represented by symbolic AI, where symbols are elements of a lingua franca between humans and deep learning. In this context, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and their underlying semantic technologies are the modern implementation of symbolic AI-while being less flexible and robust to noise compared to deep learning models, KGs are natively developed to be explainable. In this paper, we review the main XAI approaches existing in the literature, underlying their strengths and limitations, and we propose neural-symbolic integration as a cornerstone to design an AI which is closer to non-insiders comprehension. Within such a general direction, we identify three specific challenges for future research-knowledge matching, cross-disciplinary explanations and interactive explanations.},

To address these challenges, we propose GRaph-based Attention Model (GRAM) that supplements electronic health records (EHR) with hierarchical information inherent to medical ontologies. Based on the data volume and the ontology structure, GRAM represents a medical concept as a combination of its ancestors in the ontology via an attention mechanism. We compared predictive performance (i.e. accuracy, data needs, interpretability) of GRAM to various methods including the recurrent neural network (RNN) in two sequential diagnoses prediction tasks and one heart failure prediction task. Compared to the basic RNN, GRAM achieved 10{\%} higher accuracy for predicting diseases rarely observed in the training data and 3{\%} improved area under the ROC curve for predicting heart failure using an order of magnitude less training data. Additionally, unlike other methods, the medical concept representations learned by GRAM are well aligned with the medical ontology. Finally, GRAM exhibits intuitive attention behaviors by adaptively generalizing to higher level concepts when facing data insufficiency at the lower level concepts.},

The KID is a sample of discharges from all community, non-rehabilitation hospitals in States participating in HCUP. The target universe includes pediatric discharges from community, non-rehabilitation hospitals in the United States. Pediatric discharges are defined as all discharges where the patient was age 20 or less at admission. See Table 1 in Appendix I for a list of the statewide data organizations participating in the KID. The number of sample hospitals and discharges by State and year are available in Table 2 in Appendix I. The KID contains charge information on all patients, regardless of payer, including persons covered by private insurance, Medicaid, Medicare, and the uninsured. The KID's large sample size enables analyses of rare conditions, such as congenital anomalies and uncommon treatments, such as organ transplantation. It can be used to study a wide range of topics including the economic burden of pediatric conditions, access to services, quality of care and patient safety, and the impact of health policy changes. Inpatient stay records in the KID include clinical and resource use information typically available from discharge abstracts. Discharge weights are provided for calculating national estimates. The KID can be linked to hospital-level data from the American Hospital Association's Annual Survey Database (Health Forum, LLC {\textcopyright} 2010) and county-level data from the Bureau of Health Professions' Area Resource File, except in those States that do not allow the release of hospital identifiers.

Whilst a plethora of approaches have been developed for post-hoc explainability, only a few focus on how to use domain knowledge, and how this influences the understandability of global explanations from the users' perspective. In this paper, we show how ontologies help the understandability of global post-hoc explanations, presented in the form of symbolic models. In particular, we build on Trepan, an algorithm that explains artificial neural networks by means of decision trees, and we extend it to include ontologies modeling domain knowledge in the process of generating explanations. We present the results of a user study that measures the understandability of decision trees using a syntactic complexity measure, and through time and accuracy of responses as well as reported user confidence and understandability. The user study considers domains where explanations are critical, namely, in finance and medicine. The results show that decision trees generated with our algorithm, taking into account domain knowledge, are more understandable than those generated by standard Trepan without the use of ontologies.},
